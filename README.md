# python_workbook
A workbook that houses chapters and projects related to Python.

This workbook will serve as a manual for myself and anyone else as I attempt to master Python. Starting this, I do have quite a decent bit of knowledge of Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Teras, etc), however I want to cement that knowledge and as such, I'm going to keep a track of it in my workbook here.
